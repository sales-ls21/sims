# Simple Inventory Management System

### Background
I started this project as a simple side interest, basically wanting to know whether I could, using a NoSQL database (Firebase), create a simple inventory management system for a local furniture and hardware store. The design is minimal, given the utilitarian nature of the app, but also instinctual.

### About
I'm using AngularJS and Bootstrap as well as Google Firebase for the back end. I'm fully capable of creating a SQL database for this using Python, which is my scripting language of choice, but, I'm actually more interested in flexing some front end development skills so that back end needs to be pretty simple. Hence, Firebase. I might, depending on time and interest, eventually get to flexing some back end skills and building a SQL database for this same project. There's a user facing website that will be drawing from the same Firebase database, but that's still upcoming. 

### How to Download
If you're familiar at all with Git, the same basic instructions apply here. You'll want to fork or clone this repo into a local one on your machine. You'll need to make sure you have all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file and then run your local server to see the interface in action.
